# Project Name

**Author**: Roger Wells and Katrina Hill
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview

This project is designed to allow users to catalog their favorite books and make recommendations to other users.
Books can have a large impact on the reader, so what better way to have a positive influence on others than to share books that you have enjoyed.

## Getting Started

In order to build this project, it is necessary to first create the database in Mongo. We then build the schema and and setup communication between the local server and the database. From there, we setup our front end in react, and get our front and back end talking so we can send queries. Lastly,

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->

## Change Log
<!-- Use this area to document the iterative changes made to your application as each feature is successfully implemented. Use time stamps. Here's an example:

01-01-2001 4:59pm - Application now has a fully-functional express server, with a GET route for the location resource. -->

## Estimates
<!-- See below -->

## Credit and Collaborations

## Contractural agreement

## Logistical

What hours will you be available to communicate? Katrina and Roger: available 1-6pm (lab hours)
What platform will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)? Slack works for both of us.
How often will you take breaks? Every 45-50 minutes, take a break.
What is your plan if you start to fall behind? Check in with other and ask for TA help.

## Cooperative

Make a list of each parson’s strengths. Katrina: good at Google and back-end. Roger: good with front-end.
How can you best utilize these strengths in the development of your application? Lean on each other to complete the project.

In what areas do you each want to develop greater strength? Roger: problem-solving, getting stuck and not understanding error. The error codes are general and not specific. Debugging. Katrina: get better at the back-end and connecting it to the front-end.

Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand the code, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day development? Checking in with each other in the morning and afternoon before the end of lab to see what the status is of the project. Time box earlier than the close of lab to review and go over anything we didn’t understand.

## Conflict Resolution

What will your team do if one person is pulling all the weight while the other person is not contributing? Communicate. Talk to each other about anything we don’t understand and need help with.

What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other member contribute? Take time out and express our feelings about not being able to contribute property.

How will you approach each other and the challenge of building an application knowing that it is impossible for two people to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level? Communication and letting each other know that we don’t understand the material and need help.
